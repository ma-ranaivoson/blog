        My name is Ranaivoson Malala (aka Ma Ranaivoson). I&apos;m an
        enthusiast and passionate web developper specialized in JavaScript and
        PHP. My interest in web development started back in 2013 when I was in
        high school -- I&apos;ve studied HTML and tried creating webpages with
        my phone (which was not smart).

        I&apos;ve started learning computer science since 2019 but I
        don&apos;t really value degree (I VALUE SKILLS) for the reason that we
        are living in information era not in an industrial era anymore. I
        learn a lot with my personal research (mainly on google, udemy, and
        youtube) than my college courses. My main focus these days is learning
        new stuff everyday to sharpen my skills and getting knowledge because
        knowledge is power.
